# Hi there 👋

Hi there! I'm Wendy 🌟

I'm currently transitioning from UX Research to a career in Data Science.

I've been learning to code in my spare time since last year and recently started my GitHub profile. Hopefully, in the next few months, there will be more to see here! 🚀

I began learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I wanted to code my UX research portfolio and create cool features for Shopify stores, both for my own e-commerce store and for clients. Over time, I became fascinated by the data side of my work, as well as leveraging AI to improve business decisions. I'm obsessed with how data can be used to gather insights into user behaviour and to use AI to enhance user experience.


A bit about me: I was born in Cuba, grew up in Italy, and studied in the UK. I've been a solo traveler for many years and have explored over 20 countries 🌍
