## Hi there 👋

Hi there! I'm Wendy 🌟

I'm currently transitioning from UX Research to a career in Data Science.

I've been learning to code in my spare time since last year and recently started my GitHub profile. Hopefully, in the next few months, there will be more to see here! 🚀

I began with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I wanted to code my UX Research Portfolio and create cool features for Shopify stores (for my own e-commerce store and for clients). Through my work experience and education, I've realized that what I'm really passionate about is guiding decision-making through data analysis and insights 📊

I'm currently halfway through a Data Science course sponsored by Code First Girls, and I'm supplementing this with side projects 💡

A bit about me: I was born in Cuba, grew up in Italy, and studied in the UK. I've been a solo traveler for many years and have explored over 20 countries 🌍
